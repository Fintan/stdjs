* Standard JavaScript Type Definitions for the HaXe Programming Language.	

 This includes all HTML specifications plus all the new HTML5 technologies such as WebGL, 2D Canvas, 
 WebSockets, Web Workers, HTML5 Specifications, etc... 

IMPORTANT: This HaXeLib does not include all the Native JavaScript implementations of 
(Array, Number, Boolean, RexExp, Error) but instead of having to replace your standard HaXe Library 
you can instead use the "stdjs" HaXeLib and Gain acess to the full HTML5 specifications stictly typed
in your prefered HaXe Coding IDE or TextEditor.

For example usage do look at the CommonJS.hx file included and example below.

package js;

import UserAgentContext;

class HTML{
			
	public var htmlDocument : HTMLDocument;
	public var window : Window; 

	public function new() {
		htmlDocument =  untyped __js__("document");
		window =  untyped __js__("window");
	}
				
}

Then for example you can access and preform events as you would do in pure JavaScript.
